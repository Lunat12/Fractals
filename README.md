# Fractals
Project made during my first year of university, to practice OPP and recursion.

In order for it to work exactly as expected here there are some recomendations:


Pitagoras Tree

recomended direction angle --> 90
recomended lenght --> 30
recomeded base case --> 5
recomended factor --> 5
rrecomended angle --> 30

Koch Curve

recomended base case --> 1/0
recomeded iterations --> 4
recomeded lenght --> 200
recomeded factor --> 3
recomeded angle --> 60


Sierpinski Carpet

recomended angle --> 0
recomended lenght --> 200
recomended base case --> 10
recomended intial position --> 0
